# Quill

Quill is a hosted website for playing and tinkering with [Ink](https://github.com/inkle/ink) stories.

It's not intended as a "serious" story authoring environment. Rather it is a sandbox for experimenting and trying out simple things with Ink. If you are curious about Ink this ~~is~~ was a way to try it out online. (Update: Quill is no longer hosted publicly.)
