            <p>This page runs Quill, a web app for playing and tinkering with <a href="https://github.com/inkle/ink">Ink</a> stories. (Ink is a mini-language for writing choose-your-own-adventure games.)</p>
            <p>When you click Play, your Ink story will appear on the right and become playable. You can test out (and modify) the example snippets below, or play the short-but-complete Ink story The Intercept. If you're experimenting, <a href="https://github.com/inkle/ink/blob/master/Documentation/WritingWithInk.md">the Ink tutorial</a> may come in handy.</p>
            <p>If you are playing a story and making revisions as you go along, you can use Play Ink (Replay Choices) to replay your previous path on the latest revision.</p>

Time to wrap up this little game once and for all. A few guards patrol the area at night but not many — after all, very few know this place even exists.\n	Our quarters are arranged away from the main house; where we sleep is of less importance than where we work. We each have our own hut, through some are less permanent than others. Hooper's is a military issue tent: quite a large canopy, with two rooms inside and a short porch area where he insists people leave their shoes. It's all zipped up for the night and no light shines from inside.\n	I hang back for a moment. If Harris is keeping to the terms of our deal then someone will be watching this place. But I can see no—one.\n	 * (outer_zip) [Open the outer zip] \n		 	I creep forward to the tent, intent on lifting the zip to the front porch area just a little — enough to slip the component inside, and without the risk of the noise waking Hooper from his snoring.\n			The work is careful, and more than little fiddly — Hooper has tied the zips down on the inside, the fastidious little bastard! — but after a little work I manage to make a hole large enough for my hand.\n			* * [Slip in the component] 		\n					I slide the component into the tent, work the zip closed, and move quickly away into the shadows. It takes a few minutes for my breath to slow, and my heart to stop hammering, but I see no other movement. If anyone is watching Hooper's tent, they are asleep at their posts.\n					 ~ putcomponentintent  = true\n					 ~ gotcomponent = false\n					 -> return_to_room_after_excursion\n			* * [No, some other way] 			\n					Then pause. This is too transparent. Too blatant. If I leave it here, like this, Hooper will never be seen to go looking for it: he will stumble over it in plain sight, and the men watching will wonder why it was not there when he went to bed.\n					No, I must try something else — or nothing at all.\n					* * * 	[On top of the tent] -> put_component_on_tent\n					* * * 	[Throw the component into the long grass] \n					 	From inspiration — or desperation, I am not certain — a simple approach occurs to me. -> toss_component_into_bushes\n					* * * 	[Give up] \n							There is nothing to be gained here.

But nothing afford itself to slipping the component inside.\n			* * [Try the porch zip] 			-> outer_zip\n			* * [Try on top of the tent] 		-> put_component_on_tent\n			* * [Give up] 						\n				It's no good. Nothing I can do will be any less than obvious — something appearing where something was not there before. The men watching Hooper will know it is a deception and Hooper's protestations will be taken at face value.\n				If I can't find a way for Hooper to pick the component up, as if from a hiding place of his own devising, and be caught doing it, then I have no plan at all.\n				* * * [Return to my barrack] -> return_to_room_after_excursion\n				* * * [Escape the compound] -> live_on_the_run\n				* * * [Toss the component into the bushes] -> toss_component_into_bushes\n\n	 * [Hide the component somewhere] \n	 		If I leave the component here somewhere it should be somewhere I can rely on Hooper finding it, but no—one before Hooper.

If I could place it on top of the canvas, somewhere in the middle where it would bow the cloth inwards, then it would be invisible to anyone passing by. But to Hooper, it would be above him: a shadow staring him in the face as he awoke. What could be more natural than getting up, coming out, and looking to see what had fallen on him during the night?\n	\n	It's the work of a moment.
